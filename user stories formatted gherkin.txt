Scenario: User creates ticket with LB variables
	Given I have a legit project
	And I have servers in the CMDB
	Then I submit the ticket for approval
	And I am confronted with missing information

Scenario: Service-now generates JSON string with variables
	Given the ticket created and submitted successfully

Scenario: NE script maintains a local DB of requests tracked
	Given the script will run a report on all open LB changes
	And the script will compare the report of requests with the tracked list
	Then add any new requests to the tracked list

Scenario: NE script pulls JSON string from Service-now using snowfield
	Given a request has become fully approved since the last tracking report
	Then NE script will setup a cron job to implement the approved request
	And the script will send an email to the requester giving a implementation date
